subject: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, each were assigned a numeric value of 1-30 

activity: One of the six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) performed by each person

tBodyAcc-XYZ & tBodyGyro-XYZ & tGravityAcc-XYZ: Comes from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. "t" denotes time domain signals captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. "Acc" denotes gravity acceleration signals and "body" denotes body acceleration signals. XYZ denotes the 3 axes 

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ & tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ: time signals for body linear acceleration and angular velocity. XYZ denotes the 3 axes 

tBodyAccMag & tGravityAccMag & tBodyAccJerkMag & tBodyGyroMag & tBodyGyroJerkMag: magnitudes of each of the above 5 accelerometer and gyroscope signals. XYZ denotes the 3 axes 

fBodyAcc-XYZ & fBodyAccJerk-XYZ & fBodyGyro-XYZ & fBodyAccMag & fBodyAccJerkMag & fBodyGyroMag & fBodyGyroJerkMag: frequency signals of the above 7 signals described

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
mad: Median absolute deviation 
max: Largest value in array
min: Smallest value in array
sma: Signal magnitude area
energy: Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr: Interquartile range 
entropy: Signal entropy
arCoeff: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation: correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness: skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the "angle." variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
